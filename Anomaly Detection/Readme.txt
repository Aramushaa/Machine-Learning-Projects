# 🚀 Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoders and GANs  

This repository contains my **university project** on anomaly detection, leveraging **Autoencoders** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to identify anomalies. This project demonstrates how deep learning models can effectively detect outliers, with applications in fields like fraud detection, fault diagnosis, and medical imaging.

## 📖 Project Overview  

Anomaly detection is a critical machine learning problem, and this project applies advanced neural network architectures to address it:  

- **Autoencoders**: Learn to reconstruct normal data patterns. Anomalies are identified when the reconstruction error exceeds a predefined threshold.  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Generate synthetic data to differentiate between normal and anomalous patterns.  

The combination of autoencoders and GANs creates a robust system for detecting anomalies by learning the underlying distribution of normal data.
